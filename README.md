# DInvG

## Docker Image

Prior to using this tool, users may download the precompiled Docker tar file (for the x86_64 platform) from the following link:

[Download Docker tar image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CaS17VoucpnJVaxpEM3agvbfqjKOs64h/view?usp=sharing)

After downloading, the image can be loaded using the following command:

```bash
docker load -i dinvg_x86_64.tar.gz
```

## Installation

After installing the aforementioned Docker image on the x86_64 platform, navigate to the working directory. In the project root directory on Ubuntu 20.04, compile and use the tool by executing the following commands:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -jN
```

## Usage

The tool can be invoked as follows:

```bash
./bin/Inv sv path/to/file.c
```

Additionally, a Python script `scripts/exp.py` is provided in the project root to reproduce experimental results. To reproduce the data for Experiment 1 and Experiment 2, execute the following commands:

```bash
python scripts/exp.py           # Experiment 1: Data using the Propagation version
python scripts/exp.py --tool Inv_NoProp  # Experiment 2: Data using the non-Propagation version
```

The experimental results are recorded in the directories `./result/exp1/` and `./result/exp2/`, respectively.

**Note:** A minor issue is present in the `benchmark/VMCAI2019` directory. In previous experiments, an example correctly output the invariant using the Propagation version; however, subsequent modifications to Propagation resulted in an output of `Unknown`, while the non-Propagation version did not exhibit this bug. Consequently, in the associated publication, this example is temporarily marked as `Unknown`.

The discrepancy between the output and the actual results in two examples is primarily due to the fact that certain functions in SV-COMP, such as `nondet_char()`, have not yet been modeled in the current code implementation. The present code only models general numeric types, leading to an inaccurate range estimation.

## Experimental Environment

All experiments were conducted on a system with the following specifications:  
- **CPU:** 12th Gen IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ i7-12800HX, 16 cores, 2304 MHz  
- **RAM:** 9.5 GB  
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS  

In accordance with the SV-COMP competition settings, a time limit of 900 seconds was imposed for both RQ1 and RQ2. In the experimental setup, only a single core was used for testing (the tool currently does not support parallel execution). The approximate runtime for RQ1 is 30â€“60 seconds and for RQ2 is 1800â€“2000 seconds (when executed on a single core).
